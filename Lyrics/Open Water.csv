Lyrics,Song
love like a storm like an ocean endless,Open Water
love like a fire like the world is burning,Open Water
shouldve known better shouldve known better,Open Water
but you see through all the lines and then,Open Water
prove im not like all of them,Open Water
shouldve known better shouldve known better,Open Water
if your love is just a dream dont wake me up,Open Water
its hard enough to face the world alone,Open Water
if your love is just a dream dont wake me up,Open Water
its hard enough to face the world alone,Open Water
you are the one i waited for i knew it all along,Open Water
knew it all along,Open Water
you are the one im fighting for i knew it all along,Open Water
love like a dream like youre never waking,Open Water
love like your last like the sky is falling,Open Water
shouldve known better shouldve known better,Open Water
but you see through all the lines and then,Open Water
prove im not like all of them,Open Water
shouldve known better shouldve known better,Open Water
ooo ah,Open Water
you are the one i waited for i knew it all along,Open Water
knew it all along,Open Water
you are the one im fighting for i knew it all along,Open Water
sing me something thatll bring me to my knees,Open Water
thatll put my mind at ease,Open Water
please tell me anything,Open Water
we can build this like a dream,Open Water
lets make believe just you and me,Open Water
sing me something thatll bring me to my knees,Open Water
thatll put my mind at ease,Open Water
please tell me anything,Open Water
we can build this like a dream,Open Water
lets make believe just you and me,Open Water
if your love is like a dream dont wake me up,Open Water
its hard enough to face the world alone,Open Water
if this love is just a dream dont wake me up,Open Water
its hard enough to face the world alone,Open Water
if your heart stops beating god rest my soul,Open Water
dig this grave for two cant live without you,Open Water
its hard enough to face the world alone,Open Water
if your heart stops beating god rest my soul,Open Water
dig this grave for two cant live without you,Open Water
its hard enough to face the world alone,Open Water
you are the one i waited for i knew it all along,Open Water
