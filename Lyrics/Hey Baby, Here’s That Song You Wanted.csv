Lyrics,Song
i watched the sun again its leaving now,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
ive spent all night long trying to figure out,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
what ive lost and what ive found,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
when my feet wont hit the ground,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
trying to make it starting over,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
and will we ever love again,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
hey baby are you alone tonight,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
how can we make it,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
hey baby looks like you were wrong,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
its never too late too late,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
so here we are again to make some sense of it all,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
all these sudden changes,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
maybe things are not so different,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
rearranging pieces like its all we know,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
its all we know letting go,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
i keep putting together what weve lost,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
but pieces keep falling one by one,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
cause this life has us holding on,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
for tomorrow then its gone,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
for tomorrow then im gone,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
hey baby it looks like you were wrong,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
how can we make it,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
and well take it all hey baby,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
leave the rest behind,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
theres no one else tonight tonight,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
and well take it all hey baby,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
leave the rest behind,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
theres no one else tonight tonight,"Hey Baby, Here’s That Song You Wanted"
