Lyrics,Song
you were the flame but you burned out easily,Wishful Sinking
yeah and you see the light through the dark,Wishful Sinking
but you cant quite see through to me,Wishful Sinking
and every word that you waste every breath that you faked,Wishful Sinking
hope theyre keeping you up at night,Wishful Sinking
and im dying to let you go,Wishful Sinking
let you go,Wishful Sinking
youre the shore im the tidal wave,Wishful Sinking
im the reason youre coming up for air,Wishful Sinking
holding on to a memory,Wishful Sinking
you can blame it on wishful sinking,Wishful Sinking
you can blame it on wishful sinking,Wishful Sinking
id try to save you,Wishful Sinking
but what were you thinking,Wishful Sinking
so just breathe slow caught in the undertow,Wishful Sinking
and im fighting the current,Wishful Sinking
holding my ground if you cant let go,Wishful Sinking
the pressure will hold you down,Wishful Sinking
remember when you said until the end,Wishful Sinking
i swear ill never feel the same again,Wishful Sinking
youre the shore im the tidal wave,Wishful Sinking
im the reason youre coming up for air,Wishful Sinking
holding on to a memory,Wishful Sinking
you can blame it on wishful sinking,Wishful Sinking
you can blame it on wishful sinking,Wishful Sinking
id try to save you,Wishful Sinking
but what were you thinking,Wishful Sinking
id try to save you,Wishful Sinking
but what were you thinking,Wishful Sinking
every word that you waste,Wishful Sinking
every breath that you fake,Wishful Sinking
hope theyre keeping you up at night,Wishful Sinking
and im dying to let you know,Wishful Sinking
dying to let you know,Wishful Sinking
theyre coming for you,Wishful Sinking
let you know,Wishful Sinking
youre the shore im the tidal wave,Wishful Sinking
im the reason youre coming up for air,Wishful Sinking
holding on to a memory,Wishful Sinking
you can blame it on wishful sinking,Wishful Sinking
you can blame it on wishful sinking,Wishful Sinking
id try to save you,Wishful Sinking
id try to save you,Wishful Sinking
id try to save you,Wishful Sinking
but what were you thinking,Wishful Sinking
