Lyrics,Song
you cant say shit you little pale bastard and fuck all yall suck my dick,Cutthroat
i was woken from silence,Cutthroat
torn from my dreams,Cutthroat
a life less than perfect,Cutthroat
more rips at the seams,Cutthroat
you cant sew me together,Cutthroat
to fix whats been done,Cutthroat
ive felt it all but i cant feel numb,Cutthroat
ive felt it all but i cant feel numb,Cutthroat
ive felt it all but i cant feel numb,Cutthroat
so stay away,Cutthroat
weve been down this road before,Cutthroat
been barely holding on for so long,Cutthroat
for so long,Cutthroat
so keep spitting me out,Cutthroat
a bad taste in your mouth,Cutthroat
you always say to yourself that youll change,Cutthroat
so stay away,Cutthroat
weve been down this road before,Cutthroat
been barely holding on for so long,Cutthroat
for so long,Cutthroat
its safe to say,Cutthroat
i cant do this anymore,Cutthroat
and im not the only one,Cutthroat
its so wrong,Cutthroat
take this for what its worth,Cutthroat
you should know this is cutthroat,Cutthroat
cutthroat,Cutthroat
so stay away,Cutthroat
weve been down this road before,Cutthroat
been barely holding on for so long,Cutthroat
its safe to say,Cutthroat
i cant do this anymore,Cutthroat
im not the only one,Cutthroat
its so wrong,Cutthroat
so stay away,Cutthroat
weve been down this road before,Cutthroat
been barely holding on for so long,Cutthroat
for so long,Cutthroat
its safe to say,Cutthroat
i cant do this anymore,Cutthroat
and im not the only one,Cutthroat
its so wrong,Cutthroat
