Lyrics,Song
black souls empty bodies,Hollow Bodies
you had me fooled straight from the start,Hollow Bodies
we pray for an answer,Hollow Bodies
we have to fight or be hollow just like them,Hollow Bodies
walking lifeless,Hollow Bodies
have we been left for the dead,Hollow Bodies
black souls empty bodies,Hollow Bodies
we have to fight or be hollow just like them,Hollow Bodies
theyre coming for us now whoa,Hollow Bodies
so dont make a sound whoa,Hollow Bodies
is there anybody left to see the sun,Hollow Bodies
is there anybody left to cure the dead,Hollow Bodies
unaware and unaware,Hollow Bodies
unaware and unaware,Hollow Bodies
every city is burning,Hollow Bodies
were all wasting away,Hollow Bodies
nothing will end this nothing to prove,Hollow Bodies
theres nowhere to run all hell is breaking loose,Hollow Bodies
theyre coming for us now whoa,Hollow Bodies
so dont make a sound whoa,Hollow Bodies
is there anybody left to see the sun,Hollow Bodies
is there anybody left to cure the dead,Hollow Bodies
unaware and unaware,Hollow Bodies
unaware and unaware,Hollow Bodies
something tells me we could be here for a while,Hollow Bodies
and all i know is if you cant run learn to die,Hollow Bodies
and now i wonder if well make it through the night,Hollow Bodies
all i know is if you cant run learn to die,Hollow Bodies
with the setting sun put the gun in my hand,Hollow Bodies
pull the trigger dont fail me now,Hollow Bodies
with the setting sun put the gun to my head,Hollow Bodies
dont fail me now,Hollow Bodies
its starting again,Hollow Bodies
were going hollow,Hollow Bodies
were going hollow,Hollow Bodies
something tells me we could be here for a while,Hollow Bodies
and all i know is if you cant run learn to die,Hollow Bodies
and now i wonder if well make it through the night,Hollow Bodies
all i know is if you cant run learn to die,Hollow Bodies
dont fail me now,Hollow Bodies
dont fail me now,Hollow Bodies
