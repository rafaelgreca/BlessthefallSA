Lyrics,Song
im out the door i left a note,Welcome Home
with all the words that made me choke,Welcome Home
it says i know you feel alone,Welcome Home
youre scared to death of letting go,Welcome Home
sometimes you have to lose it all to find yourself,Welcome Home
id cross the world for no one else save for you,Welcome Home
but one more word before i go,Welcome Home
im scared to death youre scared youll die alone,Welcome Home
im out the door to chase what ive been searching for,Welcome Home
the spaces in between us grow youll never know,Welcome Home
im scared to death of letting go,Welcome Home
so take me out of the dark are we seconds apart,Welcome Home
my heart needs a break its an honest mistake,Welcome Home
until i find my way back,Welcome Home
help me find my way back,Welcome Home
and bring me home,Welcome Home
im not ready to believe,Welcome Home
that we were made for this collision,Welcome Home
and its just not what i need,Welcome Home
so bring me home if i make it back,Welcome Home
home if i make it back,Welcome Home
maybe you can be the reason,Welcome Home
and fix this part of me,Welcome Home
cause its just not what i need,Welcome Home
can you fix this part of me,Welcome Home
this part of me,Welcome Home
its not living if im not living with you,Welcome Home
its not living if im not living with you,Welcome Home
its not living if im not living with you,Welcome Home
its not living if im not living with you,Welcome Home
and bring me home,Welcome Home
im not ready to believe,Welcome Home
that we were made for this collision,Welcome Home
and its just not what i need,Welcome Home
so bring me home if i make it back,Welcome Home
home if i make it back,Welcome Home
maybe you can be the reason,Welcome Home
and fix this part of me,Welcome Home
cause its just not what i need,Welcome Home
so bring me home,Welcome Home
its not living if im not living with you,Welcome Home
there you go,Welcome Home
