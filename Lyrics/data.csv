Lyrics,Song
yeah,To Hell And Back
im leaving the same way i came in,To Hell And Back
looking forward but i cant see straight,To Hell And Back
its just like i know where im going,To Hell And Back
its just like me to fool myself,To Hell And Back
im right here bitch,To Hell And Back
buried by the words of a liar,To Hell And Back
but im alive and im still breathing yeah,To Hell And Back
that day becomes so haunting,To Hell And Back
you didnt say enough we were mistaken,To Hell And Back
my mind plays it over and over,To Hell And Back
slow motion,To Hell And Back
but were moving faster moving faster,To Hell And Back
so much further,To Hell And Back
lets not lose control,To Hell And Back
light a match just to watch it burn,To Hell And Back
struck,To Hell And Back
light a match just to watch you burn,To Hell And Back
where are you going how far,To Hell And Back
where are you going,To Hell And Back
lets give them hell,To Hell And Back
ill bite the bullet,To Hell And Back
just to save myself oh,To Hell And Back
oh no this ship is quickly sinking,To Hell And Back
we gotta take control gotta take control,To Hell And Back
now were moving faster moving faster,To Hell And Back
now were moving faster,To Hell And Back
im looking past the water as far as i can see,The Sound of Starting Over
these mistakes that ive made are staring back at me,The Sound of Starting Over
so im ending where i started im sinking in the sea,The Sound of Starting Over
it couldnt come much sooner screaming back at me,The Sound of Starting Over
weve come so close to the end,The Sound of Starting Over
just to pick ourselves back up and start over again,The Sound of Starting Over
without you ill start over again,The Sound of Starting Over
this is what i believe,The Sound of Starting Over
youre never gonna take away as long as im around,The Sound of Starting Over
i cant forget i wont stop now,The Sound of Starting Over
its in my blood ill show you how,The Sound of Starting Over
and i know youll never hear me now as long as im around,The Sound of Starting Over
now crawling from the bottom im digging my way out,The Sound of Starting Over
these bridges that im burning are slowly crashing down,The Sound of Starting Over
not afraid of what i started not afraid of going home,The Sound of Starting Over
if i never took my chances i would never know,The Sound of Starting Over
oh and weve come so close to the end,The Sound of Starting Over
we wont fall when were under the gun,Undefeated
when all your heroes have failed you,Undefeated
youll never show your face you are a coward,Undefeated
well never let you win ever again never again,Undefeated
preach your gospel,Undefeated
choke on your fortune and glory,Undefeated
no matter what they say were not the ones who lost our way,Undefeated
were fighting for our lives,Undefeated
its not enough to say that we were the ones who lost our way,Undefeated
all you built is in ruins,Undefeated
all you loved has been destroyed,Undefeated
and nows the time youll be forgotten,Undefeated
and nows the time your time to be,Undefeated
forgotten under when walls crash down around you,Undefeated
could tell a love,Could Tell A Love
well here go,Could Tell A Love
my big plans,Could Tell A Love
to build up this fortress into the clouds,Could Tell A Love
its made up of my love,Could Tell A Love
and my heart and my blood,Could Tell A Love

and this is all ive got,Could Tell A Love

ive fought so hard to fade,Could Tell A Love
our lives are meant to make,Could Tell A Love
made up of my love,Could Tell A Love
thats how it goes it goes,Could Tell A Love
i wont fall down,Could Tell A Love
my heart still pounds,Could Tell A Love
im breathing now,Could Tell A Love
and my blood and my heart,Could Tell A Love

neglecting life and love its one in the same thing,Looking Down from the Edge
but barely breathing,Looking Down from the Edge
i know ive got too much to lose,Looking Down from the Edge
for me to turn my back on you,Looking Down from the Edge
the writings on the wall,Looking Down from the Edge

where is the life within us,To Those Left Behind
buried inside,To Those Left Behind
where is the light that blinds us,To Those Left Behind
buried alive not ready to die,To Those Left Behind

you found me at my worst,To Those Left Behind
when i was far too weak to grow,To Those Left Behind
speaking all your shallow words,To Those Left Behind
and always casting the first stone,To Those Left Behind
in spite of all my fears,To Those Left Behind
and how i may have lost my way,To Those Left Behind
only now i know the truth,To Those Left Behind

so lets end this,To Those Left Behind
sew this last stitch,To Those Left Behind
lift this weight off my chest,To Those Left Behind
ill put you to rest,To Those Left Behind
the past should stay dead,To Those Left Behind
how did we find ourselves here,To Those Left Behind
haunted by our own design,To Those Left Behind
with everything thats come to pass,To Those Left Behind
makes it harder to confine,To Those Left Behind
reach up with open hands,To Those Left Behind
nobody left to pull me through,To Those Left Behind
and if i lose my grief,To Those Left Behind
still better off without you,To Those Left Behind
youre like a cancer living inside of me of me,To Those Left Behind
i feel the pressure,To Those Left Behind
its getting harder to breathe to breathe,To Those Left Behind
youre like a cancer living inside of me,To Those Left Behind
if you cant sleep,To Those Left Behind
its your conscience,To Those Left Behind
just remember to forget me,Sleepless In Phoenix

please take this the wrong way,Sleepless In Phoenix
dont need you to need me,Sleepless In Phoenix
i need you to disappear,Sleepless In Phoenix

of the things youve said,Sleepless In Phoenix
but you wont come home,Sleepless In Phoenix
even if youre dead,Sleepless In Phoenix
night after night,Sleepless In Phoenix
sleepless in phoenix,Sleepless In Phoenix
tell me a lie,Sleepless In Phoenix
make me believe it,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
your pieces are right here,Sleepless In Phoenix
but nothing really fits,Sleepless In Phoenix
i want you to want me,Sleepless In Phoenix
then watch me disappear,Sleepless In Phoenix
cause i carry ghosts of the things you said,Sleepless In Phoenix
i lay my bones to rest,Sleepless In Phoenix
need you to know this,Sleepless In Phoenix
tears me apart,Sleepless In Phoenix
i hope that youre hopeless too,Sleepless In Phoenix
i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
and i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
