Lyrics,Song
just remember to forget me,Sleepless In Phoenix
i hate this honestly,Sleepless In Phoenix
please take this the wrong way,Sleepless In Phoenix
dont need you to need me,Sleepless In Phoenix
i need you to disappear,Sleepless In Phoenix
cause i carry ghosts,Sleepless In Phoenix
of the things youve said,Sleepless In Phoenix
but you wont come home,Sleepless In Phoenix
even if youre dead,Sleepless In Phoenix
night after night,Sleepless In Phoenix
sleepless in phoenix,Sleepless In Phoenix
tell me a lie,Sleepless In Phoenix
make me believe it,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
your pieces are right here,Sleepless In Phoenix
but nothing really fits,Sleepless In Phoenix
i want you to want me,Sleepless In Phoenix
then watch me disappear,Sleepless In Phoenix
cause i carry ghosts of the things you said,Sleepless In Phoenix
i lay my bones to rest,Sleepless In Phoenix
night after night,Sleepless In Phoenix
sleepless in phoenix,Sleepless In Phoenix
tell me a lie,Sleepless In Phoenix
make me believe it,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
night after night,Sleepless In Phoenix
need you to know this,Sleepless In Phoenix
tears me apart,Sleepless In Phoenix
i hope that youre hopeless too,Sleepless In Phoenix
i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
night after night,Sleepless In Phoenix
sleepless in phoenix,Sleepless In Phoenix
tell me a lie,Sleepless In Phoenix
make me believe it,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
night after night,Sleepless In Phoenix
need you to know this,Sleepless In Phoenix
tears me apart,Sleepless In Phoenix
i hope that youre hopeless too,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
you got me right where you haunt me,Sleepless In Phoenix
and i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
and i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
and i know we can kiss the past goodbye,Sleepless In Phoenix
